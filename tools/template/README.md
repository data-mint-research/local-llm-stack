# Tool Template

This is a template for creating new tools for the LOCAL-LLM-Stack.

## Overview

This template provides a standardized structure for LOCAL-LLM-Stack tools, ensuring consistency across all tools and simplifying integration with the core system.

Developed by [MINT-RESEARCH](https://mint-research.com)

## Directory Structure

```
tools/your-tool-name/
├── README.md                 # Tool documentation
├── main.sh                   # Main tool script
├── lib/                      # Tool-specific libraries
│   └── common.sh             # Common functions
├── config/                   # Tool configuration
│   └── config.yaml           # Configuration file
└── tests/                    # Tool tests
    ├── unit/                 # Unit tests
    └── integration/          # Integration tests
```

## Usage

To create a new tool based on this template:

1. Copy this template directory to a new directory under `tools/`:
   ```bash
   cp -r tools/template tools/your-tool-name
   ```

2. Update the README.md with your tool's specific information

3. Modify the main.sh script to implement your tool's functionality

4. Add any tool-specific libraries to the lib directory

5. Add any tool-specific configuration to the config directory

6. Add tests for your tool in the tests directory

## Integration with LOCAL-LLM-Stack

Tools are integrated with the LOCAL-LLM-Stack through the following mechanisms:

1. **Command Line Interface**: Tools can be called from the main `llm` script
2. **Library Functions**: Tools can use the core library functions
3. **Configuration**: Tools can access the system configuration
4. **Logging**: Tools use the standard logging system

## Tool Requirements

All tools must:

1. Include a README.md file following the standard template
2. Provide a main.sh script that implements the tool's functionality
3. Follow the standard error handling and logging patterns
4. Include tests for all functionality
5. Follow the standard directory structure
