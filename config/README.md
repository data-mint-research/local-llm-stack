# Simplified Configuration Structure

This directory contains only the essential configuration files needed for core functionality.
Advanced configurations have been moved to their respective module directories:

- Monitoring configurations: `../modules/monitoring/config/`
- Security configurations: `../modules/security/config/`
- Research-specific configurations: `../modules/research/config/`

This simplified structure aligns with our optimization plan's focus on simplicity.
