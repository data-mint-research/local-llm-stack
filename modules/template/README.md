# Module Template

This is a template for creating new modules for the LOCAL-LLM-Stack.

## Overview

This template provides a standardized structure for LOCAL-LLM-Stack modules, ensuring consistency across all modules and simplifying integration with the core system.

Developed by [MINT-RESEARCH](https://mint-research.com)

## Directory Structure

```
modules/your-module-name/
├── README.md                 # Module documentation
├── docker-compose.yml        # Docker Compose configuration
├── config/                   # Configuration files
│   └── env.conf              # Environment variable defaults
├── scripts/                  # Module-specific scripts
│   └── setup.sh              # Setup script
└── tests/                    # Module tests
    ├── unit/                 # Unit tests
    └── integration/          # Integration tests
```

## Usage

To create a new module based on this template:

1. Copy this template directory to a new directory under `modules/`:
   ```bash
   cp -r modules/template modules/your-module-name
   ```

2. Update the README.md with your module's specific information

3. Modify the docker-compose.yml to include your module's services

4. Add any module-specific configuration to the config directory

5. Implement any module-specific scripts in the scripts directory

6. Add tests for your module in the tests directory

## Integration with LOCAL-LLM-Stack

Modules are integrated with the LOCAL-LLM-Stack through the following mechanisms:

1. **Docker Compose**: The module's docker-compose.yml file is included in the stack's deployment
2. **Configuration**: The module's configuration is loaded from the config directory
3. **Health Checks**: The module implements standard health checks for monitoring
4. **API**: The module exposes a standard API for interaction with the core system

## Module Requirements

All modules must:

1. Include a README.md file following the standard template
2. Provide a docker-compose.yml file if they include containerized services
3. Include health checks for all services
4. Follow the standard directory structure
5. Include tests for all functionality
