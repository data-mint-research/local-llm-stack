## Overview

The LOCAL-LLM-Stack cleanup project was undertaken to address several issues in the codebase, including:

- Inconsistent configuration formats and security issues
- Shell script quality and error handling problems
- Architectural organization and documentation issues
- Module and tool inconsistencies
- Lack of comprehensive testing and validation

The cleanup was implemented in five phases, each focusing on specific aspects of the system. This report documents the changes made in each phase and the overall improvements achieved.
