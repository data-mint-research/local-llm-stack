# LOCAL-LLM-Stack Functional Concept

## Overview

LOCAL-LLM-Stack is a comprehensive solution for running large language models (LLMs) locally on your own hardware. It provides a complete environment for deploying, managing, and interacting with LLMs without relying on external cloud services, ensuring privacy, control, and cost efficiency.

## Core Functionality

### 1. Local LLM Deployment

LOCAL-LLM-Stack uses Ollama to run LLMs directly on your hardware. This allows you to:

- Run models like Llama 3, Mistral, Gemma, and Phi-3 locally
- Maintain full control over your data and conversations
- Operate without an internet connection
- Avoid usage fees associated with cloud-based LLM services

### 2. User-Friendly Interface

The stack includes LibreChat, a web-based chat interface that provides:

- Clean, intuitive chat experience similar to commercial offerings
- Conversation history and management
- Multiple model support with easy switching between models
- Customizable settings and preferences

### 3. Modular Architecture

The system is built with a modular architecture that allows for:

- Core functionality (LLM engine, chat interface, database)
- Optional modules for enhanced capabilities:
  - **Monitoring**: Performance tracking and visualization
  - **Security**: Enhanced security features and SSL support
  - **Scaling**: Horizontal scaling for improved performance

### 4. Command-Line Management

A unified command-line interface (`llm`) provides easy management:

- Starting and stopping services
- Managing models (listing, adding, removing)
- Configuration management
- Status monitoring
- Debugging capabilities

## User Workflows

### Initial Setup

1. User installs LOCAL-LLM-Stack
2. User generates secure secrets for configuration
3. User starts the stack
4. User accesses the LibreChat web interface
5. User adds desired models

### Daily Usage

1. User starts the stack if not already running
2. User accesses LibreChat through the web browser
3. User selects a model and starts a conversation
4. User can view conversation history and manage past chats

### Model Management

1. User lists available models
2. User adds new models as needed
3. User removes unused models to free up disk space

### Configuration and Customization

1. User views current configuration
2. User edits configuration to adjust settings
3. User restarts the stack to apply changes
