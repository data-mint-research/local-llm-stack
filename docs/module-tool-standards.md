# Module and Tool Standards

This document outlines the standardized structure and integration patterns for modules and tools in the LOCAL-LLM-Stack project.

## Overview

The LOCAL-LLM-Stack uses a modular architecture with two main extension mechanisms:

1. **Modules**: Self-contained components that provide specific functionality to the stack, typically running as Docker containers.
2. **Tools**: Utility scripts that perform specific tasks, such as documentation generation, configuration validation, or system maintenance.

This standardization ensures consistency, improves maintainability, and simplifies the process of creating new modules and tools.

## Module Standards

### Directory Structure

All modules should follow this standard directory structure:

```
modules/module-name/
├── README.md                 # Module documentation
├── docker-compose.yml        # Docker Compose configuration
├── api/                      # Module API
│   └── module_api.sh         # Standardized API interface
├── config/                   # Configuration files
│   └── env.conf              # Environment variable defaults
├── scripts/                  # Module-specific scripts
│   └── setup.sh              # Setup script
└── tests/                    # Module tests
    ├── unit/                 # Unit tests
    └── integration/          # Integration tests
```

### Module README Template

Each module must include a README.md file that follows the standard template. The README should include:

1. Module name and overview
2. Features and capabilities
3. Prerequisites
4. Installation and configuration instructions
5. Usage examples
6. Troubleshooting information

### Docker Compose Standards

Module Docker Compose files should follow these standards:

1. Use the standard network `llm-stack-network`
2. Use environment variables with defaults for all configurable values
3. Include proper health checks for all services
4. Use standard volume mounting patterns
5. Include appropriate resource limits

### Module API

Each module should implement the standardized Module API interface, which provides:

1. Standard methods for starting, stopping, and restarting the module
2. Health check functionality
3. Configuration management
4. Status reporting
5. Logging access

### Module Integration

Modules integrate with the core system through:

1. The `module_integration.sh` library in the core system
2. Standardized Docker Compose integration
3. Consistent configuration management
4. Unified health check reporting

### Module Testing

Each module should include:

1. Unit tests for module-specific functionality
2. Integration tests that verify the module works with the core system
3. Test documentation

## Tool Standards

### Directory Structure

All tools should follow this standard directory structure:

```
tools/tool-name/
├── README.md                 # Tool documentation
├── main.sh                   # Main tool script
├── lib/                      # Tool-specific libraries
│   └── common.sh             # Common functions
├── config/                   # Tool configuration
│   └── config.yaml           # Configuration file
└── tests/                    # Tool tests
    ├── unit/                 # Unit tests
    └── integration/          # Integration tests
```

### Tool README Template

Each tool must include a README.md file that follows the standard template. The README should include:

1. Tool name and overview
2. Features and capabilities
3. Prerequisites
4. Usage instructions and examples
5. Configuration options
6. Integration with other components

### Tool Script Standards

Tool scripts should follow these standards:

1. Use a consistent command-line interface pattern
2. Implement standard error handling and logging
3. Use configuration files for all configurable values
4. Include proper documentation and help text
5. Return standardized exit codes

### Tool Integration

Tools integrate with the core system through:

1. The `tool_integration.sh` library in the core system
2. Standardized command-line interface
3. Consistent configuration management
4. Unified logging and error handling

### Tool Testing

Each tool should include:

1. Unit tests for tool-specific functionality
2. Integration tests that verify the tool works with the core system
3. Test documentation

## Creating New Modules and Tools

### Creating a New Module

To create a new module:

1. Use the module template:
   ```bash
   cp -r modules/template modules/your-module-name
   ```

2. Update the module files with your specific implementation:
   - Modify the README.md with your module's information
   - Update the docker-compose.yml with your services
   - Implement your module's functionality
   - Add appropriate tests

3. Register the module with the core system:
   ```bash
   ./llm module register your-module-name
   ```

### Creating a New Tool

To create a new tool:

1. Use the tool template:
   ```bash
   cp -r tools/template tools/your-tool-name
   ```

2. Update the tool files with your specific implementation:
   - Modify the README.md with your tool's information
   - Update the main.sh script with your tool's functionality
   - Configure your tool in config.yaml
   - Add appropriate tests

3. Make the main script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x tools/your-tool-name/main.sh
   ```

## Best Practices

### Module Best Practices

1. **Isolation**: Modules should be self-contained and not depend on other modules
2. **Configuration**: All configurable values should use environment variables with sensible defaults
3. **Health Checks**: All services should implement health checks
4. **Documentation**: All module functionality should be well-documented
5. **Testing**: All module functionality should be covered by tests

### Tool Best Practices

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each tool should have a single, well-defined purpose
2. **Reusability**: Extract common functionality into shared libraries
3. **Error Handling**: Implement consistent error handling and reporting
4. **Documentation**: Include comprehensive help text and examples
5. **Testing**: All tool functionality should be covered by tests

## Integration Testing

The integration between modules, tools, and the core system should be tested using:

1. **Module Integration Tests**: Verify that modules work correctly with the core system
2. **Tool Integration Tests**: Verify that tools work correctly with the core system
3. **End-to-End Tests**: Verify that the entire system works correctly with all modules and tools

## Conclusion

Following these standardized patterns for modules and tools ensures consistency, improves maintainability, and simplifies the process of extending the LOCAL-LLM-Stack with new functionality.
